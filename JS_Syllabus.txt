	website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

	file    : node-v14.15.4-x64.msi


2) download and install VisualStudioCode

									***** Variables *****
	- variables are used to store the data.
			Ex.
					string
					number
					boolean
					Objects
					arrays

	- we will declare variables by using "var" , "let" and "const" keywords.

	- "let" and "const" keywords introduced in ES6.

	- variables should contain a-z , A-Z , 0-9 , $ and _

	- variables should not start with numbers.

Syntax.
		var/let/const variablename = value;



> json-server --watch demo1.json

=> http://localhost:3000/employees



CallBacks in JavaScript

	- passing one function to another function as an argument called as "callback".

	- in general, we will use callbacks, while making "asynchronous" calls.
